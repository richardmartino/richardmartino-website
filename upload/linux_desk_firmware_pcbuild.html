<h1 id="Switched%20to%20Linux,%20New%20Desk,%20PC%20Build,%20New%20Printer%20Firmware">Switched to Linux, New Desk, PC Build, New Printer Firmware</h1>

<p>June 22nd, 2020</p>

<p>Hello World! I have been busy during the last few weeks of May. I switched to Linux on my main laptop, decided to start a new desktop build, began building my new desk, and wrote new firmware to my 3D Printer!</p>

<h2 id="Why%20I%20Switched%20to%20Linux">Why I Switched to Linux</h2>

<p>During finals week I had run into so many Windows workflow errors it had driven me crazy. I had vowed to switch from Windows permanently from that point on after I had finished all of my finals. I have been using Linux on and off for the past few years. My server, goldwater, has been running Linux for awhile now and I think a full Linux setup would best suit my workflow. Right now on my Thinkpad T460s I am running Ubuntu 20.04 and I have installed ArchLabs on my new Ryzen build, Grant.</p>

<h2 id="New%20Desk">New Desk</h2>

<p>My old desk setup consisted of two crummy $100 desks from Amazon and it worked for awhile. I had gotten to the point where I required something better and I wanted to free up some space in my room. My dad and I built a desk with metal tube legs he bought on Amazon and a sheet of plywood cut down the middle. We laminated the two pieces of plywood together after splitting it down the middle to make a desk that is 2&#8217; x 8&#8217; and 1 &#190;&#8221; thick. I finished it with ebony stain and three coats of polyurethane.

<h2 id="New%20PC%20Build">New PC Build</h2>

<p>My desktop build centers around a Ryzen 5 3600 and an RX560. I bought a 250GB NVME SSD along with 16GB of RAM. I am running ArchLabs on it and I have decided to make the hostname Grant, after President Ulysses S. Grant. I name all of my PCs after US Presidents and all of my network devices after US Senators. I bought a new miniATX case, but it wasn&#39;t compatible with my RX560. I took the new case I bought and transferred the internals of goldwater into it. Grant, the new PC, will be residing in goldwater&#39;s old ATX case.</p>

<h2 id="New%20Printer%20Firmware">New Printer Firmware</h2>

<p>I updated the firmware on my Monoprice Maker Select V2 as well as added a bootloader to the Arduino inside so I can update it on the fly. I think I might have broken the LCD as it isn&#39;t showing anything on it, but the active buzzer on the board it is attached to is still working. I will likely control the printer with Octoprint as I did before.</p>

<p>Over and out,
Richard</p>
