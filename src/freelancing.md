# Hudson Valley Freelance Electronic Product Development Services

## Capabilities and Services
I am committed to delivering the best possible products and or services to my clients. I am equipped with a full electronics testing and prototyping lab and have access to the latest fully featured design, simulation, and development programs.

### 3D Modeling and Prototyping
I have 6+ years experience with 3D Modeling and 2D Drafting. I am also proficient with additive and subtractive manufacturing. Design for production and efficient prototyping is what I focus on. I have a 3D printer and am capable of printing with exotic and experimental filaments as well as more commonly used ones.

Mechanical designs not requiring plastics or additive manufacturing techniques are also a capability. Local manufacturing partners can assist in providing CNC, Laser, Plasma and other automated manufacturing processes.

### Electrical Design Automation (PCB Design, Prototyping and Small Batch Manufacturing)
If your product requires a printed circuit board, I can work with small batch manufacturers to produce prototypes.

All boards are designed and assembled in house. Once a client is satisfied with a final design, I can assist in getting the boards mass manufactured.

### Firmware Development
I have been programming as long as I have been producing 3D models, I can design and prototype robust firmware for your product and integrate it with in house designed hardware or hardware you already have.

### Project Consulting and Planning
Have an idea for a project but don't know where to start? I can assist in all parts of the planning process as well as implementing the plan.
