Hello, I'm Richard!

I'm an Electrical Engineer from Ulster County, New York in the Lower Hudson Valley. I am a graduate student at SUNY New Paltz, and I am studying Embedded Systems and their security.

I love tinkering and making things. This website is home to my repository of creations and projects. Occasionally I will post about what I do, what I make, and the things I am interested in.
