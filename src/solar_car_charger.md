# Solar Car Battery Charger
August 13, 2020

## Project Introduction
A few weeks ago, my dad and I decided that we should make a solar charger for my car's battery. Since my car would be sitting for awhile due to current world circumstances we'd like the battery not to die.

## Purpose and Intended Use
We made this simple system to charge the batter of my car while the sun is out. It maintains the 12V wet cell battery in my car.

## Design
It was built with a 10W solar panel, an MPPT battery charger/maintainer, a circuit breaker to prevent current/reverse current spikes, and a 12V cigarette adapter. We are using one of the two 12V plugs in the car to charge the battery. Seen below is a diagram of how we have it wired up.

## Final Thoughts
This was a cool quick project that served a much needed utility. I am currently thinking of future solar panel projects as we have plenty of them around the house. Maybe something with an ESP32-CAM next?

Over and out,
