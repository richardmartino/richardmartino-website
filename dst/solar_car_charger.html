<h2 id="Project%20Introduction">Project Introduction</h2>

<p>A few weeks ago, my dad and I decided that we should make a solar charger for my car&#39;s battery. Since my car would be sitting for awhile due to current world circumstances we&#39;d like the battery not to die.</p>

<h2 id="Purpose%20and%20Intended%20Use">Purpose and Intended Use</h2>

<p>We made this simple system to charge the batter of my car while the sun is out. It maintains the 12V wet cell battery in my car.</p>

<h2 id="Design">Design</h2>

<p>It was built with a 10W solar panel, an MPPT battery charger&#47;maintainer, a circuit breaker to prevent current&#47;reverse current spikes, and a 12V cigarette adapter. We are using one of the two 12V plugs in the car to charge the battery. Seen below is a diagram of how we have it wired up.</p>

<h2 id="Final%20Thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This was a cool quick project that served a much needed utility. I am currently thinking of future solar panel projects as we have plenty of them around the house. Maybe something with an ESP32-CAM next?</p>

<p>Over and out,
