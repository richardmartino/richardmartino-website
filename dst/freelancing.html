<h2 id="Capabilities%20and%20Services">Capabilities and Services</h2>

<p>I am committed to delivering the best possible products and or services to my clients. I am equipped with a full electronics testing and prototyping lab and have access to the latest fully featured design, simulation, and development programs.</p>

<h3 id="3D%20Modeling%20and%20Prototyping">3D Modeling and Prototyping</h3>

<p>I have 6+ years experience with 3D Modeling and 2D Drafting. I am also proficient with additive and subtractive manufacturing. Design for production and efficient prototyping is what I focus on. I have a 3D printer and am capable of printing with exotic and experimental filaments as well as more commonly used ones.</p>

<p>Mechanical designs not requiring plastics or additive manufacturing techniques are also a capability. Local manufacturing partners can assist in providing CNC, Laser, Plasma and other automated manufacturing processes.</p>

<h3 id="Electrical%20Design%20Automation%20(PCB%20Design,%20Prototyping%20and%20Small%20Batch%20Manufacturing)">Electrical Design Automation (PCB Design, Prototyping and Small Batch Manufacturing)</h3>

<p>If your product requires a printed circuit board, I can work with small batch manufacturers to produce prototypes.</p>

<p>All boards are designed and assembled in house. Once a client is satisfied with a final design, I can assist in getting the boards mass manufactured.</p>

<h3 id="Firmware%20Development">Firmware Development</h3>

<p>I have been programming as long as I have been producing 3D models, I can design and prototype robust firmware for your product and integrate it with in house designed hardware or hardware you already have.</p>

<h3 id="Project%20Consulting%20and%20Planning">Project Consulting and Planning</h3>

<p>Have an idea for a project but don&#39;t know where to start? I can assist in all parts of the planning process as well as implementing the plan. </p>
